Pickle Protocol is designed for students, parents(Guardians), college administrative staffs to assist the forward progress of the collegiate experience. For everyday users who want to save in case they ever find themselves in a “pickle.”

Why is your idea/solution needed?

Educational cost are steadily increasing, leaving graduates in high debts after graduation and leaving them scrambling to pay not only through college but after college.
Pickle Protocol looks to create a network of nodes across colleges/ students allowing for students to not only receive and spend money. But, use the coin to pay for necessary collegiate things such as books, transportation, tuition and much more.

Future Development/ Wallet Development Functionality

TheJar mining function "opt in based" portion where burned PCK is sent into (the PCK foundation) which is annually awarded to 4 students to assist in collegiate debt/ parents of a student/student entrepreneurs.

Major difference would be that coins are locked in a node style in the wallet to unlock this feature. Maturity level etc.

(The Pickle Jar foundation) which is annually awarded to x members on The website will be host to TheJar as well which will serve as a social platform for people to network and campaign.

The Jar feature is designed to aide with saving for the future. The locked coin allows for not only network security, but it creates a long term growing roi. Savings is a key to our future, so is security. This feature allows for setting long term goals, as well as short term. Click it and forget it. The wallet will alert you when a block is unlocked.
