Pickle Protocol is designed for students, parents(Guardians), college administrative staffs to assist the forward progress of the collegiate experience, as well as an everyday  peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Pickle Protocol will serve not only as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash but as a method of usage as a savings/storage similar to the traditional “CDs” used in financial institutions for users who want to save in case they ever find themselves in a “pickle.”

Educational cost are steadily increasing, leaving graduates in high debts after graduation and leaving them scrambling to pay not only through college but after college.
Pickle Protocol looks to create a network of nodes across colleges and globally allowing for students/parents/administration and everyday user to not only receive and spend money. But, use the coin to pay and save for necessary collegiate things such as books, transportation, tuition and the future.

Major difference to traditional master nodes functionality would be that coins can be locked for designated lengths of times to earn  pck, spears and chips which are the units in which Pickle Protocol will use.

The Pickle Jar foundation will be annually awarded to a specified total members that are active on the platforms website. This website will be used as a social platform for people to network/campaign and utilized cryptocurrency in a whole..

The Jar feature is designed to aide with saving for the future. The locked coin allows for not only network security, but it creates a long term growing roi. Savings is a key to our future, so is security. This feature allows for setting long term goals, as well as short term. Click it and forget it. 


Conclusion

One of the things that has plagued cryptocurrency with negativity overall, has a lot to do with projects out their in the crypto-verse that honestly only care about the bottom dollar and not about the preservation of society as a whole. One of the very important things we have sworn to uphold is visibility and transparency of what we are trying to accomplish.
